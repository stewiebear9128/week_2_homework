# Week 2 Homework

The goal of this homework is to familiarize ourselves with the Bootstrap front-end framework.

## An experiment

We're going to try something new this week; as homework, you are going to watch a video and work along with it. Then, during class, we'll try to have more hands-on labs.

**The hope is that you'll be able to follow along with the material better if you can pause and rewind at your own pace, and in class we'll have more time for labs and conversation.**

I look forward to your feedback!

## Introduction

There are several parts to this homework.

First, we'll learn how to improve the landing page that we made in class by using the Bootstrap framework to achieve pixel-perfect positioning.

Next, we'll learn how to make our pages look prettier by using built-in Bootstrap classes for common web elements like buttons.

Next, we'll apply what we learned to the roster we started building in class.

Finally, you will familiarize yourself with the Bootstrap documentation by creating a cheatsheet for yourself. **This last part is not graded; it's just for your own benefit, so feel free to do it at your leisure.** You don't have to submit it by next week.

Remember, think up lots of questions to ask on First Draft or in class! That's the whole point.

The instructions (and solutions) can be found in the [Week 2 Homework Instructions video](http://dsgn425-s15.github.io/videos/week_2_hw_instructions.html).
